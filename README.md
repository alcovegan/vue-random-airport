# vue-random-airport

## Demo


## About

This is project inspired by [@flopp](https://github.com/flopp) project - [airports_map](https://github.com/flopp/airports_map). I just want to build something like this, but with VueJS.

## Data

Airports data partially taken from [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/data/) (i use they airports csv data for filtering my own data by size of airport) and partially information that taken from another open sources. So, here you can see is 568 airports marked as "large_airport" in OurAirports data.

## Notes

In this first version all the data and scripts are bundled together, so, build file a bit large. Also, there is no adequate mobile version.

V2 be better :)

## Setup and build

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
